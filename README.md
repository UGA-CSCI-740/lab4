# lab4

## Goal

EDF (Earliest Deadline First) is one of the most common schedules used in industry. This is due to its simplicty and the fact it is and optimal scheduling algorithm on preemptive uniprocessors. You will understand this better in this lab.

## What you have to do

### Everyone

- [ ] Create a [EDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_deadline_first_scheduling) schedual for the dinning philosophers.
- [ ] Have the program print out the execution time to the screen.
- [ ] Use [SimSoWeb](http://projects.laas.fr/simso/simso-web) to create a scheduling diagram.
NOTE: You will create a scheduling diagram for every lab from now on!

### Grad students

- [ ] Implement the [LLF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_slack_time_scheduling) schedualer in Zephyr.

## What you need to turn in
Note: As with all labs going forward everything should be saved to a directory called solution in your repository.

- [ ] Console capture of the schedual running.
- [ ] The generated schedule from SimSoWeb.
